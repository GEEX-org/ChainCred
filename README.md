## 🎯 Introduction

Open-source powers the internet but struggles with sustainable incentives. Contributors are often undervalued, reducing motivation and long-term participation.

**ChainCred** redefines how open-source contributions are valued and rewarded by combining cutting-edge blockchain technology with community-driven governance. We're not just shaping the future of open source — we're making it unstoppable.

With sustainable tokenomics, validator accountability, and transparent governance, ChainCred ensures that contributions are rewarded fairly—laying the foundation for a long-lasting and resilient open-source economy.

## ❌ Problem Statement

**Open source faces critical sustainability challenges:**

- **Lack of Sustainable Incentives**: Open source powers the internet but still lacks sustainable incentive models
- **Fragmented Support Systems**: Existing support systems are fragmented, centralized, and overly dependent on donations and sponsorships
- **No Unified Reward Model**: There is no unified, transparent, and community-driven reward model to value contributions fairly
- **Poor Incentive Alignment**: Without proper alignment of incentives and quality validation, open source struggles to remain self-sustaining
- **Contributor Undervaluation**: Contributors often face undervaluation, leading to reduced motivation and long-term participation
